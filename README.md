### Description
**Calculator**: Build a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**Hangman Game**: Create a command-line version of the popular Hangman game. The program should choose a word at random, and the user must guess the letters in the word.

**Tic Tac Toe**: Build a simple Tic Tac Toe game that allows two players to play against each other on the command line.

**Guess the Number**: Develop a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess the number. The program should give hints to the user if their guess is too high or too low.

**Simple Text Editor**: Build a simple text editor that allows users to create, edit, and save text files.

**Snake Game**: Create a classic Snake game, where the player controls a snake that grows longer as it eats food and dies if it hits a wall or its own tail.

**Sorting Algorithms**: Implement some of the popular sorting algorithms, such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.

**Library Management System**: Create a program that simulates a library management system. The program should allow users to add and remove books, search for books by author or title, and track borrowed books.

**Student Management System**: Develop a program that manages student records. The program should allow users to add and remove students, update student information, and generate reports.

**File Compression**: Implement a program that can compress and decompress files using various compression algorithms, such as Huffman Coding or LZW.
